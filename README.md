PHONE

Concept*

the outgoing call number should be toggleable or inputable to proxy the outgoing number to the business number.
The phone portion will be its own app. In this app techs and managers will be able to make calls via twilio with an inputed number or via the phone book. The system will accept a phone number in settings for the tech which will use a twilio number to call that number and connect the inputed customer number to a recorded call. Also accept incoming and outgoing sms and mms funtions.
